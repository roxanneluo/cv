1.1 [8.2013-1.2014] Adaptive Cost Aggregation Strategy via Loop-erased Random Walk, ICIP 2014, http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~luoxuan/papers/icip2014.pdf.
	I proposed to use a random tree generated by Loop-erased Radom Walk (LERW) to replace traditional minimum spanning tree in non-local methods. LERW achieves better results especially over curved & slanted surfaces due to its more adaptive support windows (SW). I also provided a mathematical analysis to explain this strength of randomness, giving deeper understanding of SWs of the tree-based algorithms.
1.2 [2.2014-8.2014] An Effective Disparity-Prediction-Based Accelerator (DPA) for Stereo Matching, IJCV (submitted), http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~luoxuan/papers/IJCV.pdf.
	I proposed the DPA, a general framework for typical tree-based algorithms to improve speed and accuracy. For example, with DPA, the segment-tree based algorithm is 6.25 times faster and 3.04% more accurate over Middlebury 2006 half-size dataset. More specifically, I contributed:
􏰃 	1) the Disparity Prediction Model, a Bayesian model to predict the disparity,
􏰃 	2) the Disparity Prediction Forest (DPF), which utilizes the prediction result to speed up. Moreover, instead of using color similarity to approximate disparity similarity, it defines disparity similarity based on disparity information directly and improves the accuracy.

2.1 [8.2014-10.2014] Purine, Slides at http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~luoxuan/slides/purine_introduction.html. 
	Purine is a flexible graph-based parallel deep learning framework. It outperforms current widely-used deep learning frameworks in that its graph-based design allows any kind of parallelism, both data and model parallelism, arbitrary network structure (e.g., recurrent neural network), and can utilize unlimited number of CPUs and GPUs. And it’s fast and easy-to-use. I contributed the multi-GPU & multi-machine data copy part, the key bottleneck for all parallel frameworks, testing codes and part of the network definition protocol. It will be released soon.
2.2 [10.2014–now] Gradient of CNN.
	I’m trying to exploit information contained in the gradient of CNN on object detection.

3.1 [3.2012–3.2013] Development of Low Cost Test-bed for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) On- board Intelligence.
	This is an National Undergraduate Innovation Program. I led four other team members to build a toy submarine equipped with an embedded computer, a gyro, a barometer, etc., to automatically drive itself. I learned the PID controller, designed and implemented a sliding mode control system, assembled the submarine and carried out a series of underwater experiments.
